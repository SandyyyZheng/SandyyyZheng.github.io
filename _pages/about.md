I am an incoming M.S. student in Computer Science at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). Prior to that, I earned my B.E. degree in Information Security at [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) (HFUT), advised by [Dr. Yuanzhi Yao](http://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/yaoyz/zh_CN/index.htm). My current research is focused on natural language processing, particularly in the area of LLM safety.
